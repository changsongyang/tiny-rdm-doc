# `1.1.12` (2024-04-27)

### Optimizations

* The cli parsing with JSON strings is incorrect.
* Support some shortcut keys (quick exit dialog with `ESC`, quick delete selected key with `Del`, refresh with `F5` or `Cmd+R`, rename with `F2`)

### Fixes

* Content refresh may not work
* Sub/pub is not available in cluster mode.
* The calculated number of delete keys in cluster mode is incorrectly.
